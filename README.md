Honors Project - Dungeon of New Orleans

Dungeon of New Orleans is a text-based mini-RPG starring the player taking a class in dungeoneering. The player must type responses in order to advance through randomly ordered levels. The game features a rock-paper-scissors combat system, engaging bosses, and lots of text.

This is my first Java program outside my Software Design class' course curriculum.

Enjoy this simple-yet-frustrating game!
